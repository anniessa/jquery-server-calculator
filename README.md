# jQuery Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 1 weekend_

This is a calculator that generates calculations on the server. The server can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Once the calculation is complete, a record of all math operations remain in the server. A list of previous calculations is displayed on the DOM and updated when a new calculation is made.
